    "## Background\n",
    "Isolated RNA needs to be quantified in order to have the correct amount of starting input for RNA library preparation for sequencing. The input used for library prep. can i.e. have a range from 5 - 200 ng, where the optimal can be at 100 ng.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research sequencing facility (RSF) has two devices for RNA quantification, of which both use a different methods:\n",
    "- [NanoDrop 2000](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/ND-2000) (ThermoFisher) measures light intensity in a range of different light wavelengths. [Manual](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/CAD/manuals/NanoDrop-2000-User-Manual-EN.pdf)\n",
    "- [TapeStation 4200](https://www.agilent.com/en/product/automated-electrophoresis/tapestation-systems/tapestation-instruments/4200-tapestation-system-228263) (Agilent) measures fluorescently stained fragements that are separated by electrophoresis.

    "  - [High Sensitivity RNA](https://www.agilent.com/en/product/automated-electrophoresis/tapestation-systems/tapestation-rna-screentape-reagents/high-sensitivity-rna-screentape-analysis-228267), Quantitative Range of 0.5 - 10 ng/µL\n",
    "  - [Standard RNA](https://www.agilent.com/en/product/automated-electrophoresis/tapestation-systems/tapestation-rna-screentape-reagents/rna-screentape-analysis-228268), Quantitative Range of 25 - 500 ng/µL\n",
